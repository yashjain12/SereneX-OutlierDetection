I had a fun time at my data science internship at SereneX, and one of the most involved processes was to experiment with anomaly detection, which would be a handy component in our final project: a Weekly Health Tracker. For the weekly health tracker, it was of utmost importance to accurately determine whether there would be marginal or significant changes in biometric data of a particular user.

I scraped data using FitBit API over a 5 month period for experimentation (Heart Rate, Heart Rate Variability, Step Count, and Quality of Sleep).
